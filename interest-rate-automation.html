									<h1>The Interest Calculator Story<br />
										A Tale of Rapid Innovation</h1>
									<p>Sometimes the most important projects start with the most urgent conversations. This is the story of how a Tuesday afternoon crisis became a lesson in collaborative problem-solving and the power of thinking fast together.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/interest_options_alteryx.JPG" alt="Alteryx workflow automating interest rate calculations at Marex" /></div>

								<h2>The Beginning</h2>
								<p>It was a Tuesday afternoon when the clearing team burst into my corner of the office. "John, we have a problem," they said, and I could hear the urgency in their voices.</p>

								<p>The firm had no way to calculate interest on our options EOD (End of Day) and ITD (Inception to Date), and clients were waiting. This wasn't just another request - this was critical. Client money was involved, compliance was at stake, and every hour of delay meant potential losses.</p>

								<p>"How long do we have?" I asked.</p>

								<p>"We needed it yesterday," came the reply.</p>

								<p>That's when I knew this would be different from my usual collaborative approach. Sometimes you have to build the plane while flying it.</p>
								
								<h2>The Journey</h2>
								<p>I pulled up a chair and said, "Tell me everything." Over the next hour, we whiteboarded the problem together. What started as a complex financial calculation challenge became a collaborative puzzle-solving session.</p>

								<p>The questions came fast:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>"What's the difference between EOD and ITD calculations?"</li>
									<li>"Where does the rate data come from?"</li>
									<li>"What happens with weekend dates?"</li>
									<li>"How do we handle different option types?"</li>
									<li>"What's the exact formula for each scenario?"</li>
								</ul>

								<p>I asked questions they hadn't considered, and they shared insights I would never have discovered alone. The urgency actually helped - there was no time for overthinking, just pure problem-solving.</p>

								<p>That evening, I stayed late and developed a quick Python script - nothing fancy, but it worked. The next morning, we tested it together.</p>

								<p>"It's calculating the overnight interest correctly!" they exclaimed. But we weren't done yet.</p>

								<h2>The Solution</h2>
								<p>Over the next few weeks, what began as an emergency Python script evolved into something beautiful. Each iteration brought new insights:</p>

								<ul>
									<li><strong>Week 1:</strong> Basic calculations working - crisis averted</li>
									<li><strong>Week 2:</strong> Added ITD vs EOD differentiation</li>
									<li><strong>Week 3:</strong> Automated the entire process</li>
									<li><strong>Week 4:</strong> Migrated to Alteryx for compliance and support</li>
								</ul>

								<p>The final solution could accurately calculate and payout clients on interest accrued, handling edge cases we discovered along the way. But the real magic was in how we built it together, even under pressure.</p>

								<p><strong>2. Calculation Engine:</strong><br />
								The core of the solution is a sophisticated calculation engine that applies different interest rate formulas based on instrument type, maturity, and market conditions. I implemented business rules that automatically select the appropriate calculation method and apply the correct parameters.</p>

								<p><strong>3. Validation and Quality Assurance:</strong><br />
								Every calculation is automatically validated against multiple sources and historical data. The workflow includes built-in checks that flag any results outside expected ranges and generates alerts for manual review when necessary.</p>

								<p><strong>4. Automated Reporting:</strong><br />
								The final component generates formatted reports for different stakeholders, including operations teams, risk management, and regulatory reporting. Reports are automatically distributed via email and saved to shared network locations.</p>

								<h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
								<p>The solution leverages several key technologies:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Alteryx Designer:</strong> Primary workflow development platform</li>
									<li><strong>Python Scripts:</strong> Custom calculations and API integrations</li>
									<li><strong>SQL Databases:</strong> Data storage and historical analysis</li>
									<li><strong>REST APIs:</strong> Real-time market data integration</li>
									<li><strong>Excel Integration:</strong> Report generation and distribution</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>Results and Impact</h2>
								<p>The implementation of this automated solution has delivered significant benefits to Marex:</p>

								<h3>Quantifiable Improvements:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Time Savings:</strong> Reduced daily calculation time from 4 hours to 15 minutes</li>
									<li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Eliminated calculation errors, achieving 100% accuracy rate</li>
									<li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Improved audit trail and regulatory reporting capabilities</li>
									<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Can handle 10x more calculations without additional resources</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>The Impact</h2>
								<p>Today, what once caused daily stress runs automatically. The clearing team can focus on strategic work instead of manual calculations. But more importantly, we prevented potential losses and ensured our clients receive accurate interest payments.</p>

								<p>Six months later, I ran into one of the clearing team members in the hallway. "Remember that crazy Tuesday when we had no way to calculate interest?" she asked, laughing. "I can't believe we used to do that manually. Now it just happens."</p>

								<p>That's the moment I knew we'd truly succeeded. The crisis had become routine, the manual had become automatic, and the stress had become confidence.</p>

								<h3>The Numbers</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Daily time savings:</strong> 4 hours reduced to 15 minutes</li>
									<li><strong>Accuracy rate:</strong> 100% - eliminated calculation errors</li>
									<li><strong>Client impact:</strong> Accurate interest payments, every time</li>
									<li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Improved audit trail and regulatory reporting</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>The Lessons</h2>
								<p>This project taught me that the best solutions come from true collaboration, even under extreme pressure. As a citizen developer, I'm not just writing code - I'm translating human needs into digital solutions.</p>

								<h3>What I Learned About Crisis Innovation</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Urgency clarifies priorities:</strong> When time is short, you focus on what really matters</li>
									<li><strong>Collaboration accelerates solutions:</strong> Two minds working together solve problems faster than one</li>
									<li><strong>Iteration beats perfection:</strong> A working solution today beats a perfect solution next week</li>
									<li><strong>Trust builds quickly:</strong> When you deliver under pressure, people believe in your next idea</li>
								</ul>

								<p>The urgency of this project also showed me how quickly we can innovate when we work together with a shared purpose. Sometimes the best solutions come not from careful planning, but from rolling up your sleeves and solving the problem in front of you.</p>

								<p><em>This project reminded me why I love being a citizen developer: when someone has a problem, I get to be the person who says, "Let's solve this together."</em></p>
