					<h1>Hi, I'm John<br />
					</h1>
					<p>I'm a Futures Brokerage Analyst and Citizen Developer at Marex. My true passion? Being handed a problem I know nothing about and diving in headfirst.<br /><br />
					There's something exhilarating about sitting down with a team, staring at a challenge that seems impossible, and knowing that together we'll figure it out. I believe the most important thing isn't having all the answers - it's understanding the real problem. Once you nail that, the solution always reveals itself.<br /><br />
					My technical skills got me in the door at Marex, but it's my attitude that keeps me solving problems. I don't quit. I don't give up. Because I know there's always a way - and the more obstacles we face, the more opportunities we have to learn something incredible.<br /><br />

								<h2><a href="streamlit-report-generator.html">The Report Generator Story<br />
								</a></h2>
								<p>"I wish I could just upload this file and get my report," Tom said, gesturing at his screen full of Excel formulas. "What if you could?" I asked. His eyes lit up. That conversation sparked what became our most-used tool at Marex.<br /><br />
								What started as a simple question over coffee became a journey of collaboration, iteration, and ultimately, a solution that transformed how our entire team works with data. This isn't just about code - it's about lifting the burden of manual work from people's shoulders.</p>

										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="interest-rate-automation.html" class="image fit"><img src="images\interest_options_alteryx.JPG" alt="Alteryx workflow automating interest rate calculations at Marex" /></a>
									<p><strong>The Beginning:</strong> It was a Tuesday afternoon when the clearing team burst into my corner of the office. "John, we have a problem," they said. The firm had no way to calculate interest on our options EOD and ITD, and clients were waiting.<br /><br />
									<strong>The Journey:</strong> I pulled up a chair and said, "Tell me everything." What started as a complex financial calculation challenge became a collaborative puzzle-solving session. That evening, I stayed late and developed a quick Python script - nothing fancy, but it worked.<br /><br />
									<strong>The Impact:</strong> Today, what once caused daily stress runs automatically. The clearing team can focus on strategic work instead of manual calculations. But more importantly, we prevented potential losses and ensured our clients receive accurate interest payments.<br /><br />
									<em>"This project taught me that the best solutions come from true collaboration. As a citizen developer, I'm not just writing code - I'm translating human needs into digital solutions."</em></p>

									<a href="xtp-data-integration.html" class="image fit"><img src="images\XTP_alteryx.JPG" alt="Alteryx workflow for automated XTP data integration at Marex" /></a>
									<p><strong>The Beginning:</strong> It was a Monday morning when I bumped into Sarah from operations in the break room. She looked exhausted, clutching her coffee like a lifeline. "We spent six hours yesterday pulling XTP data," she sighed. "And the worst part? I know compliance was doing the exact same thing."<br /><br />
									<strong>The Journey:</strong> That conversation sparked a cross-team collaboration to break down data silos. Working with operations, compliance, and risk management, we discovered that everyone was fighting the same battle - just in different ways.<br /><br />
									<strong>The Impact:</strong> "Now I actually get to be an analyst instead of a data entry clerk," Sarah told me months later. Three teams, one source of truth, and people finally free to focus on what matters.<br /><br />
									<em>"This project taught me that the most complex technical challenges often have the simplest human solutions."</em></p>

									<p><strong>The Foundation:</strong> Every journey has a beginning. This academic project was where I first discovered my love for turning messy data into meaningful insights. Working with a massive movie dataset, I learned that data cleaning isn't just about code - it's about understanding the story the data wants to tell.<br /><br />
									<strong>The Learning:</strong> Through SQL and SAS, I discovered that the most beautiful visualizations mean nothing if the underlying data isn't clean. This project taught me patience, attention to detail, and the importance of questioning every assumption.<br /><br />
									<strong>The Connection:</strong> Looking back, this is where my passion for helping others with data challenges first sparked. Every manual process I see at Marex reminds me of those late nights cleaning movie data - and how much better it feels when the process is automated.<br /><br />
									<em>"This project planted the seed that grew into my mission: making data work for people, not the other way around."</em></p>

								<h2>Living Two Lives at Marex</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Being both a Futures Brokerage Analyst and a Citizen Developer isn't about wearing two hats - it's about building bridges.</p>

							<p>In my analyst role, I understand the daily struggles of manual processes, the frustration of repetitive tasks, and the risk of human error in critical calculations. This gives me unique insight when someone approaches me with a problem.</p>

							<p>As a citizen developer, I get to be the person who says, "Let me help you solve that." There's no greater satisfaction than seeing a colleague's face light up when they realize they'll never have to do that manual task again.</p>

							<p><strong>This dual perspective has taught me that the best solutions come from truly understanding both the technical and human sides of a problem. It's not about the code - it's about the people.</strong></p>
