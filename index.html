					<h1>Hi, I'm John<br />
					</h1>
					<p>I'm a Futures Brokerage Analyst and Citizen Developer at Marex. What started as solving my own operational problems evolved into something bigger when colleagues across departments began reaching out after seeing my initial work.<br /><br />
					As a citizen developer in a large enterprise, I've discovered the power of providing options to solve problems quickly and efficiently - especially when traditional IT red tape restricts solution delivery speed. When the head of clearing needed interest calculations and IT estimated over a year, I delivered a Python script in hours. That's the speed advantage of citizen development.<br /><br />
					My journey shows how organic growth happens in enterprises: start by solving your own problems, demonstrate value, and watch as departments reach out for help. I've learned that having agile problem-solving options alongside formal IT processes is crucial for enterprise success.<br /><br />

								<h2><a href="streamlit-report-generator.html">Comprehensive Reporting Platform<br />
								</a></h2>
								<p>After colleagues saw my initial automation work, multiple departments began reaching out with similar reporting challenges. What started as solving individual problems evolved into a comprehensive reporting platform - demonstrating how citizen development can scale from personal solutions to enterprise-wide tools.<br /><br />
								This unified platform now serves as a centralized hub for various reporting needs across departments, allowing users to upload data and generate professional reports while maintaining the agility that formal IT processes often lack. It's about creating options for rapid problem-solving in large enterprises.</p>

									<p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> The head of clearing reached out after seeing my initial automation work. Marex had no way to calculate interest on options for EOD and ITD reporting. Client money was at stake, compliance deadlines were approaching, and IT estimated over a year to deliver a solution.<br /><br />
									<strong>The Speed Advantage:</strong> I developed a Python script that solved the problem in hours - demonstrating the speed advantage of citizen development over traditional IT processes. This evolved through phases: immediate Python fix → enhanced validation → enterprise Alteryx integration → full automation with audit trails.<br /><br />
									<strong>The Enterprise Value:</strong> Delivered in hours vs. IT's 1+ year timeline, reduced daily processing from 4 hours to 15 minutes, eliminated manual errors, and met regulatory requirements with full compliance. This showcased how citizen development bypasses red tape while maintaining enterprise standards.<br /><br />

									<p><strong>The Data Democratization Challenge:</strong> Multiple departments were manually extracting the same data, creating bottlenecks and inconsistencies. Raw data from various sources needed transformation into digestible, structured formats for Finance and other teams.<br /><br />
									<strong>The Collaborative Solution:</strong> Working directly with our data team, I implemented Alteryx-based data processing workflows that automated transformation of raw data into analysis-ready formats. This created standardized data pipelines feeding multiple downstream users.<br /><br />
									<strong>The Enterprise Impact:</strong> Finance and other teams now have direct access to structured data through automated scheduling and quality assurance frameworks. This enhanced partnership between business users and the data team while ensuring data integrity and consistency.<br /><br />

									<p><strong>The Foundation:</strong> Every journey has a beginning. This academic project was where I first discovered my love for turning messy data into meaningful insights. Working with a massive movie dataset, I learned that data cleaning isn't just about code - it's about understanding the story the data wants to tell.<br /><br />
									<strong>The Learning:</strong> Through SQL and SAS, I discovered that the most beautiful visualizations mean nothing if the underlying data isn't clean. This project taught me patience, attention to detail, and the importance of questioning every assumption.<br /><br />
									<strong>The Connection:</strong> Looking back, this is where my passion for helping others with data challenges first sparked. Every manual process I see at Marex reminds me of those late nights cleaning movie data - and how much better it feels when the process is automated.<br /><br />
									<em>"This project planted the seed that grew into my mission: making data work for people, not the other way around."</em></p>

								<h2>Citizen Development in Enterprise: The Value Proposition</h2>
							</header>
							<p>My journey at Marex demonstrates the unique value of citizen development in large enterprises - providing agile problem-solving options that complement traditional IT processes.</p>

							<h3>Speed and Agility</h3>
							<p>Solutions delivered in hours/days vs. months/years through traditional IT. When the head of clearing needed interest calculations and IT estimated over a year, I delivered a working Python script in hours. This rapid prototyping and iterative improvement eliminates communication gaps through direct business user involvement.</p>

							<h3>Problem-Solving Flexibility</h3>
							<p>Multiple technology platforms (Python, Alteryx, Streamlit) based on optimal fit for each challenge. The ability to address immediate needs while building toward enterprise solutions, with cross-departmental collaboration without formal project overhead.</p>

							<h3>Enterprise Integration</h3>
							<p>Solutions that start small but scale to enterprise requirements. My projects include compliance and audit trail capabilities when needed, and demonstrate collaboration with IT and data teams rather than replacement.</p>

							<h3>Organizational Impact</h3>
							<p>Breaking down silos between departments through shared solutions. Demonstrating the value of empowering business users with technical capabilities. Creating options for problem-solving that bypass traditional red tape restrictions while maintaining enterprise standards.</p>
