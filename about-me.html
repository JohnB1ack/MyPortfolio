									<h1>About Me<br />
										From Finance Analyst to Citizen Developer</h1>
									<p>Bridging the gap between business needs and technical solutions through formal education, continuous learning, and hands-on enterprise experience at Marex.</p>
								</header>

								<h2>Professional Background</h2>
								<p>I'm a Futures Brokerage Analyst and Citizen Developer at Marex, where I've discovered my passion for solving complex enterprise problems through technology. My journey began with automating my own daily operational tasks, but quickly evolved when colleagues across different departments saw the value and began reaching out for help with their challenges.</p>

								<p>What drives me is the opportunity to bridge the gap between immediate business needs and enterprise-scale solutions. In large organizations, having options to solve problems quickly and efficiently is crucial - especially when traditional IT red tape restricts solution delivery speed. I've found that citizen development provides that crucial agility while maintaining enterprise standards.</p>

								<h2>Educational Foundation</h2>
								<h3>Formal Education</h3>
								<p><strong>Miami University, Farmer School of Business (August 2019 - May 2023)</strong><br />
								Bachelor of Science in Finance with Minor in Data Science</p>

								<p>This dual foundation in business operations and data analytics provides the essential perspective for effective citizen development in enterprise environments. Understanding both the financial implications and technical possibilities allows me to create solutions that truly serve business needs.</p>

								<h3>Professional Certification</h3>
								<p><strong><a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/864JC4C2SPNG" target="_blank">Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate</a> (August 2023)</strong><br />
								Specialized in Python Programming, Machine Learning, and Data Science</p>

								<p>This certification bridges academic knowledge with practical enterprise applications, providing the technical depth needed to implement sophisticated solutions in real-world business environments.</p>

								<h2>Technical Expertise</h2>
								<h3>Programming & Development</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Python (Advanced):</strong> Primary language for automation, data processing, and enterprise solutions</li>
									<li><strong>SQL:</strong> Database querying, data extraction, and reporting</li>
									<li><strong>R:</strong> Statistical analysis and data science applications</li>
									<li><strong>JavaScript, HTML/CSS:</strong> Web development and user interface design</li>
									<li><strong>Alteryx:</strong> Enterprise data processing and workflow automation</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Data & Analytics</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Power BI & Tableau:</strong> Business intelligence and data visualization</li>
									<li><strong>Excel (Advanced):</strong> Complex modeling, automation, and analysis</li>
									<li><strong>SAS:</strong> Statistical analysis and data management</li>
									<li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Predictive modeling and data science applications</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Financial Systems</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Atlantis, GPS, ERECS:</strong> Core trading and operations platforms</li>
									<li><strong>PeopleSoft:</strong> Enterprise resource planning</li>
									<li><strong>FIA Tech Atlantis API:</strong> System integration and automation</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Emerging Technologies</h3>

									<li><strong>N8N:</strong> Workflow automation and integration</li>
									<li><strong>Langchain & CrewAI:</strong> AI agent development and orchestration</li>
									<li><strong>MCP Development:</strong> Next-generation AI application frameworks</li>
									<li><strong>AI/ML Frameworks:</strong> Building proof-of-concept multi-agent systems</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>Career Progression</h2>
								<p>My evolution from futures brokerage analyst to citizen developer happened organically. It started with a simple need: automating my own repetitive tasks to focus on more strategic work. But when colleagues saw the results, they began approaching me with their own challenges.</p>

								<p>This organic growth demonstrated something powerful about citizen development in large enterprises. When the head of clearing needed interest calculations and IT estimated over a year for delivery, I was able to provide a working Python script in hours. That speed advantage - delivering solutions in hours vs. years - became a defining characteristic of my approach.</p>

								<p>What makes this approach successful isn't replacing formal IT processes, but complementing them. I work directly with our data team, collaborate with IT governance, and ensure solutions meet enterprise standards while maintaining the agility that business users desperately need.</p>

								<h2>What Drives My Passion</h2>
								<p>There's something incredibly satisfying about sitting down with a team, understanding their real problems, and knowing that together we can figure out a solution. I believe the most important thing isn't having all the technical answers - it's understanding the business problem deeply enough that the right solution reveals itself.</p>

								<p>Every manual process I encounter is an opportunity. Every frustrated colleague represents a chance to give someone their time back. When I see a team spending hours on tasks that could be automated in minutes, I see potential - potential to free people to focus on work that truly matters.</p>

								<p>My technical skills opened doors, but my attitude keeps me solving problems. I don't quit. I don't give up. Because in every challenge, there's an opportunity to learn something incredible and help someone work more effectively.</p>

								<h2>Continuous Learning</h2>
								<p>The technology landscape evolves rapidly, especially in AI and automation. I'm constantly researching next-generation technologies, building proof-of-concept systems, and exploring how emerging tools can solve tomorrow's enterprise challenges.</p>

								<p>Currently, I'm diving deep into multi-agent AI systems, exploring how technologies like CrewAI and Langchain can create more sophisticated automation solutions for financial services. This isn't just academic curiosity - it's about staying ahead of the curve to provide even better solutions for enterprise challenges.</p>

								<p><em>Ready to see what happens when curiosity meets determination? Let's solve something together.</em></p>
